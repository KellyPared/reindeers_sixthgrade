# Reindeer Code Challenge

## For 6th Grade Computer Science

* Students are provided a screenshot of the code to copy.
* Students must use a list method to add Rudolph to the reindeers list (without physically editing the list).
* Students need to complete the output to read:
>>"You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen
But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"

* Students can change the code to make it more pythonic if capable.  This is written purposefully with redundant functions using different list methods.
